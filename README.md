# Vigenère Cipher - Python Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Vigenère Cipher**, a classical encryption technique that encodes or decodes a message using a custom key.

## Features
- **Encrypt Text**: Encode a given message using the Vigenère cipher and a custom key.
- **Decrypt Text**: Decode an encrypted message back to its original form using the same key.
- **User Input**: Allows dynamic input for both the text to be processed and the custom key.

## Code Overview
The implementation includes:
1. **`vigenere` function**: Core logic for the encryption and decryption process.
2. **`encrypt` function**: Simplifies encryption calls.
3. **`decrypt` function**: Simplifies decryption calls.

The script is interactive and requires user input for:
- The text to encrypt or decrypt.
- The custom key to be used for the cipher.

## Example Use Case
- **Text Input**: `aospw'u zhmgivdt rmphhag? o jabt, g uoz, q tua cgjqjsg—artk htan!`
- **Custom Key**: `happycoding`
- **Decryption Output**: `"Today's LeetCode contest? I came, I saw, I got crushed—send help!"`

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Classic-Vigenere-Cipher
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   pyhton Cipher_Project.py
4. You can change the text, and custom key to user passed input if you like


### Explanation of the Steps:
- **Step 1**: Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
- **Step 2**: Navigate to the project directory after cloning it.
- **Step 3**: Run the script by executing the Python file.
- **Step 4**: Enter the text you want to encrypt/decrypt and the custom key when prompted.
- **Step 5**: Based on whether you're encrypting or decrypting, the program will output the respective result.
- **Step 6**: You can change the `text` and `custom_key` variables directly in the Python script for predefined cases.
- **Step 7**: You can add more test cases by modifying the script to see how it behaves with different inputs.
